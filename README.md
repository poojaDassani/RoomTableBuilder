# SqliteDbToRoomTable
Convert SQLite Db schema to Room Database Table Entities without manual work

1.Change the path of db file as per the need.
2.It will create files in kotlin extension, so change the extension if needed.



After making these changes, run the script again, and it should generate the Kotlin files in the same directory as the script without any file not found errors.

Please note that this script provides a basic example and may require modifications to match your specific requirements, such as customizing annotations, handling data type conversions, or adding relationships between tables.

I hope this helps you get started with generating Room entity classes from an SQLite database schema.
